6 figure grid references https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wainwrights 
eg. Scafell - NY215072.
First two letters are location, the squares are as follows:
NY
SD
NY directly north of SD
Easting - 215
Northing 072
Squares are 100 x 100 km, so
215 - 21,500m east
072 - 7,200m north
So euclidean distance between first 3 and second three is in terms of 100m.

Task - scrape this data into python, turn into coordinates, plot.
