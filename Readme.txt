#### README - wainwright ####

The Wainwrights are 214 hills/mountains in the Lake District, UK.

To begin with we aim to solve the TSP (Travelling Salesman's Problem) to find the shortest loop taking in all 214 peaks, using just the xy-coordinates of the hills as scraped from Wikipedia.
As the project progresses the hope is to introduce more data sources such as height, and possibly using map data to 
The ultimate aim is to construct the most realistic tour possible!

Project aims:
  - gain further experience in Python
  - synthesise multiple data sources
  - develop visualisation skills
  - create a unique, personal data science project
